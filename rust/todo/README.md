# Rust Todo CLI

## Description

A todo cli application written in Rust.

The application allows the user to add, delete, view and clear todos.

This app writes the todos to a file, meaning that they are persisted between executions.

## Installation

- clone the repo
- run `cargo build` at the root
- run the built executable
- optionally move the executable to wherever you want on your system, add it to the PATH, etc

## Improvements

I think the app could be improved in a few ways:

- make it possible to mark todos as 'done' (as opposed to having to delete them entirely)
- allow the user to perform multiple actions per execution (as opposed to having to re-run the app every time)
- output could be improved, perhaps with colours and better organisation
